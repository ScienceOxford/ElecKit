Example code &amp; wiring

The .png files show you which pins on the micro:bit to connect your new components to!

Take a crocodile clip, and connect one end of it to the micro:bit's pin, and the other end of it to your the lead of your component.

Take a second crocodile clip, and connect this one the same way, but to the other pin and lead!

For the RGB LED, it has four leads, but you only have two crocodile clips! The GND pin must always be connected, but choose one of the others to connect, and see what happens (or get two more crocodile clips so you can connect all three at once!).


The .py files are example code to use the components.
Test the code, then try adding your new components into another micro:bit program (for example a name badge: https://www.instructables.com/id/Felt-Microbit-Name-Badge-Craft-Coding/)
